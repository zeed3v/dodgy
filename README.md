 First Unity 3D Game done with C#
 
 Simple rules i didn't got time to do rn:
 
 1.- If you get an obstacle red for the second time, you're dead. 
 2.- You start at a Spawn Point Pad, the endgame is to get to the one on the other side of the room, without getting more than 1 obstacle red.
 3.- You can download the whole repository on a Zip and run the exe. Sadly, still havn't gone through the courses that teach GUI and Menus. Alf+f4 is the only way i got to close the game.
 4.- Press W A S D to move.
 
 Have fun!
